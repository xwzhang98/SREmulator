# SREmulator

A trained Super-Resolution (SR) + Emulator model for N-body cosmological simulations.

SREmulator first applies super-resolution techniques to the output of N-body cosmological simulations. It then emulates the true high-resolution simulation using a separate trained Emulator conditioned on initial conditions. For more detailed descriptions, refer to [Paper-III](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad3940) and [Paper-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09051).
